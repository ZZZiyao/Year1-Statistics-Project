This group project revolves around the statistical analysis that led to the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Utilizing Python and a simulated dataset, we replicate a similar analysis to explore the presence of the Higgs boson through the decay channel 𝐻 → 𝛾𝛾. The project aims to use statistical tools to identify the signal of the Higgs boson against a background of standard particle collision outcomes.
